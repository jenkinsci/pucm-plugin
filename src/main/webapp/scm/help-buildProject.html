PUCM offers the option to have an extra ClearCase project to host all the streams needed to build. This is done to avoid a lot of irrelevant streams in the integration-stream. Please make an extra project for this purpose and type the name here. If you don't type anything, PUCM will assume you have a project called 'hudson'. 
If you don't have this extra build-project, pucm will place a stream in your integration project for every new job.
If you change or set the build-project, then you need to make a new job in hudson, otherwise pucm will just use the already made stream.
