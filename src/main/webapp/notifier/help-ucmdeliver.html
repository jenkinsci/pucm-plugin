This Post Build step to PUCM enables you to harvest your healthy baselines and deliver them to another stream. Typically an integration stream in a stable or release project. The deliver is only executed if the build step was successful (or empty). The deliver is aborted and canceled, and the post build step fails, if the deliver includes any non-trivial merges
