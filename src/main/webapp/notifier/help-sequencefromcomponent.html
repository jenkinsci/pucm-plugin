Use the attribute attached to the Component:<br>
buildnumber.sequence<br>
<br>
Even if you may not want to use persisted build attributes for major, minor and patch it still may be a good idea to use it for the sequence. This enables that sequence numbers are sequential across projects (maintenance projects and development projects) and any rejected builds will not cause fall-outs between the build sequence attributes. Don't use this option if the account running the job doesn't have access to write new values to ClearCase.<br>

See more details regarding this option on the <a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/pucm+plugin">PCUM wiki</a>.
